### Analysis Process
For multi-trait analyses, EasyOmics calculates the distribution of phenotypes, phenotypic variance, genetic variance, and narrow-sense heritability using the AI-REML method. 

For single trait EasyOmics presents the phenotype distribution in a density plot and visualizes population structure through PCA analysis of SNP data in a scatter plot, annotating each point with its corresponding ID.
