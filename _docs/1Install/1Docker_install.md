Docker is an open-source project developed in Go language, which could package software and its dependencies into images for a quick deployment environment.

For users, please visit Docker's official website to download the Docker Desktop application: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Notes:
  - For Windows users, WSL2, the dependency of Docker, will be automatically installed during Docker Desktop install. If an error occurs, users need to refer to Microsoft's documentation to download and set up the [WSL2 subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) manually, and check the [install steps of docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).
  - For Mac users, the macOS operating system is suitable for docker desktop installation, and theoretically that will not fail. If an error occurs, users need to refer to the [install steps of docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).
  - If your network can not access the Docker Desktop website, please contact us, and we will provide a download link of Netdisk.
